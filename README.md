This project is an Augmented Reality (AR) design tool built using Unity . It allows users to explore and interact with various 3D models.The app allows users to visualize and design their living spaces by placing virtual furniture objects in real-world environments through the camera of their mobile devices.

## Description

To create an application that can provide a user friendly interface.
This project is an Augmented Reality (AR) design tool built using Unity . 
It allows users to explore and interact with various 3D models.The app allows users to visualize and design their living spaces by placing virtual furniture objects in real-world environments through the camera of their mobile devices.


## Getting Started

To run the AR Furniture Design App on your device, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Project: Launch Unity and open the project folder.
3. Build and Run: Set up the necessary build settings for your target platform (e.g., iOS or Android). Build the project and run it on your device.
4. Print Marker Image: Before using the app, print the marker image provided in the repository. This marker will be used to anchor the virtual furniture objects in the AR environment.
5. Start Designing: Launch the app on your device, grant the necessary camera permissions, and point the camera towards the marker image. The app will detect the marker and place a virtual floor plane for furniture placement.
6. Select and Place Furniture: Browse the furniture catalog and select a furniture item. Use touch gestures to place, rotate, and resize the furniture object in the desired location.
7. Customize and Save: Customize the furniture's appearance if desired by selecting different materials, colors, or styles. Save your design to review or modify it later.
8. Share your Designs: Share your design creations with others by exporting images or videos or directly sharing them through social media platforms.

## Features

Once the AR furniture is installed and running on your device, you can:

1.	Interactive user interface where user can interact with 3D models.
2. AR Furniture Placement: Users can place virtual furniture objects, such as chairs, tables, sofas, etc., in their real-world environment using augmented reality technology. They can drag, rotate, and resize the furniture to fit their desired layout.
3. Catalog of Furniture: The app provides a catalog of various furniture items that users can choose from. Each item includes a 3D model, textures, and relevant information like dimensions, materials, and prices.
